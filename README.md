# Alzheimer's-Detection-Game
To detect Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurologic disorder, we have developed an android app comprising of a game which is structured in such a manner that it checks 10 major cognitive abilities such as attention, recall, visuo-perception etc., of the user. The app takes age, education levels, linguistic, cultural factors, family and medical history, habits and mood patterns from the user, which  plays a substantial role in Alzheimer's Detection.
The major highlight is that Visually Impaired users can also benefit from the app with the help of various gestures like tap, swipe etc.
Innovative features like connecting with Nearby Doctors, Chatbot, Multi-language support, re-accessibility of past results, have been integrated using Google APIs (location, text to speech etc.) to enhance usability and provide all rounded guidance to the user blended in a single application. It allows QR Code Generation for the doctors to access the results.
The game is inspired by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Self-Administered Gerocognitive Exam (SAGE) which have worldwide recognition for its accuracy and precision making it reliable.
